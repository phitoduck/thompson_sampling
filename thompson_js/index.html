          <h3>What Is Thompson Sampling?</h3>
          <p>With a heaping wad of cash in hand, you stand in front of a row of slot machines wondering which one has
            the highest win rate. This is called the <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit">“multi-armed bandit problem”</a>. (A slot machine
            is a one-armed
            bandit, so really it should be called the “multiple one-armed bandits problem”). Thompson Sampling is the
            algorithm that will most optimally get you to the best slot machine.</p>
          <p>Besides gambling, two other applications of Thompson Sampling are advertising and medicine. You might be
            wondering which
            version of your website out of many has the highest conversion rate, or which cancer drug has the lowest
            rate of rejection by the human body. These questions can both be framed as multi-armed bandit problems.
          </p>

          <img src="./src/images/bandit.jpg" height="450px">
          <p><em>Slot machines are called "bandits" because they rob people. Given any number of bandits, Thompson
              Sampling seeks
              to find the one with the highest expected payout.
            </em></p>

          </br>
          <h3>The Pitfalls of A/B Testing</h3>
          <p>Many companies approach the advertising question posed above with a very naïve approach. If we have three
            versions of our
            advertisement, why don’t we host all three versions for one week? And at the end, we’ll see which version
            got the most clicks.</p>
          <p class="highlighted">This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing">A/B testing</a>. A/B
            Testing is a basic, controlled experiment where all product versions are
            distributed equally to users. </p>
          <p>Question: But what if two of my three website versions are <em>awful?</em></p>
          <p>Depending on our specific implementation of A/B testing, we would be exposing the bad websites to <em>two
              thirds</em> of our users. That means the majority of our customer base is getting a second-rate product
            for
            some period. With this process, advertising companies may spend months hosting the worst versions of their
            ad before A/B testing allows them to change course.</p>

          <p><strong>Note</strong>, another criticism of A/B testing is that it is difficult to perform when there are
            many variants
            to be tested. With limited time or resources, it may simply be infeasible to test each version equally.
          </p>
          <p>In recent years, Thompson Sampling has gained a lot of popularity in industry for “solving” the A/B test
            problem using fewer resources than A/B testing. Rather than administering all variants equally, Thompson
            sampling intelligently chooses to investigate one branch at a time.</p>

          <img src="./src/images/thompson_vs_gittens.png" width="500px">
          <p><em>This figure compares Thompson Sampling to one of its rivals, the Gittens Algorithm.
              "Number of Pulls" refers to the the total number of decisions and updates over the life of the problem.
              Observe that the two algorithms win roughly the same amount, but Thompson is O(1) while Gittens is O(k^n)
              where k is twice the number of bandits and n is the number of pulls. <a href="">Python code here</a>
            </em></p>

          </br>
          <h3>Cat Website Example</h3>
          <p>Consider our three versions of the cat adoption website above. </p>
          <p>Given a cat website you may choose to (1) adopt a cat, or (2) leave. Upon clicking, the algorithm records
            your response. Then, it performs a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference">Bayesian
              update</a> on the prior distribution of possible values of the
            conversion rate for the version with the wet cat.</p>
          <p>Let’s walk through it:</p>
          <p>Say, you click “sample” and the wet cat version pops up. After seeing it, you are so alarmed that you
            can’t even imagine having one of these creatures living anywhere near where you sleep. Naturally, you
            politely click “Not today…” and shudder at the thought of the freakish animal you just escaped.</p>
          <p>You will now see the wet cat beta distribution decrease. Click “sample” again. When you do this, the
            algorithm takes a random sample from each cat website distribution. Then it serves you whichever version
            corresponds to the largest sample. </p>
          <p>Fortunately, since you just rejected that awful wet monster, there is less likelihood that the next
            picture you will see is the wet cat. It’s still possible, but less likely now. </p>
          <p>If—for some unfathomable reason—you clicked “Adopt a Cat” after seeing the wet cat (maybe your hand
            slipped?), then you would now have the blessing of seeing it more often. </p>

          </br>
          <h3>A Potential Downfall of Thompson Sampling</h3>
          <p>A reason not to use Thompson sampling might if swapping out test branches more than once is infeasible.
            For example, say you wanted to know which billboard ad on a highway side is most effective. In this case,
            the cost/effort of swapping out billboard variations is significant. </p>
          <p>Here, you could consider switching ads more infrequently (maybe wait a week or a month at a time). All
            the data you collect between decision points simply give you more information about where the true value
            of the conversion rate could plausibly lie.</p>
